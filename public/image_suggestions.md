# Image Suggestions 🖼️

## Purpose

This file stores curated image suggestions for text-to-image generation and provides guidance on how to write high-quality prompts.

---

## How to store suggestions

- Recommended directory for actual image files: `public/images/suggestions/` (or reference an external URL).
- File naming convention suggestion: `YYYYMMDD_slug.ext` (e.g., `20260112_sunset-glass-city.jpg`).
- Each suggestion should be a markdown section with a clear title and metadata (see the template below).

## How to write useful prompts (tips) 💡

- **Be specific.** Include subject, environment, mood, and any relevant action.
- **Define style and era.** (e.g., "Victorian oil painting", "digital concept art", "photorealistic").
- **Mention lighting and time of day.** (e.g., "golden hour, rim light, volumetric fog").
- **Specify camera & lens cues for photorealism.** (e.g., "35mm, shallow depth of field, bokeh").
- **Tell the model the level of detail.** (e.g., "ultra-detailed, intricate textures, 8k").
- **Use negative prompts to avoid unwanted artifacts.** (e.g., "lowres, watermark, text, missing fingers").
- **Include composition guidance.** (e.g., "rule of thirds, subject centered, foreground interest").
- **Add color direction.** (e.g., "muted pastels", "high contrast teal and orange").
- **Iterate & record variants.** Save alternate prompts and parameter changes (seed, steps, scale) so results can be reproduced.

## Prompt examples

### Example 1 — Photorealistic landscape
- **Prompt:** "A photorealistic landscape photograph captures a hyper-realistic sunset over a futuristic glass city. Reflective skyscrapers stretch into the sky, their mirrored facades catching warm orange and magenta highlights; flying vehicles streak between towers; cinematic rim lighting and volumetric haze create dramatic depth; ultra-detailed textures, realistic reflections, atmospheric perspective, shot with a 35mm lens and shallow depth of field, filmic color grading, 8k."
- **Negative prompt:** "lowres, watermark, extra limbs, text, cartoonish"
- **Notes:** Use wide aspect (16:9), emphasize warm color grading and crisp reflections. Include camera cues (lens, DOF) for photorealism.

### Example 2 — Painterly portrait
- **Prompt:** "A close-up painterly portrait of an elderly woman rendered in Rembrandt-style oil painting; soft directional Rembrandt lighting creates strong chiaroscuro; warm earth tones and layered brushstrokes give tactile texture; subtle imperfections and emotional expression; ultra-detailed skin pores and hair strands; medium-format lens feel; high-resolution canvas detail."
- **Negative prompt:** "blurry, disfigured, text, oversaturated"
- **Notes:** Use 4:5 aspect; request visible brushstrokes and canvas texture; specify the level of detail.

### Example 3 — Ancient collapsing flume in old-growth forest (detailed)
- **Prompt:** "A photorealistic landscape photograph captures an ancient, collapsing wooden flume extending into a dense, old-growth forest. Moss and thick ivy drape heavily from the decaying trestle structure, casting long, intricate shadows through shafts of dramatic sunlight piercing the forest canopy. The wooden beams are rotted and broken, with sections of the flume sagging and fallen. Below, a fern-covered forest floor and a rushing creek are partially visible. The atmosphere is melancholic and overgrown. Film grain."
- **Negative prompt:** "lowres, watermark, overexposed, text, modern structures"
- **Notes:** Aim for a moody, melancholic atmosphere; emphasize volumetric light shafts, rich texture detail, and film grain. Suggested aspect ratios: 3:2 or 16:10; use shallow depth to slightly soften distant canopy.

## Workflow suggestions ✅

- Keep each suggestion self-contained (title + metadata + example prompt). This helps reuse and automation.
- Optionally maintain a simple CSV/JSON data file for programmatic consumption (columns: id, title, prompt, tags, ref_image, license).

**Guidelines for agents:**
- Prefer concise, reproducible entries. Include generation parameters and a seed when possible.
- If a suggestion is tested, attach output samples (in `public/images/suggestions/` or via a PR). Link to PRs or commits in the **Status** field.
- Keep entries focused; avoid adding large binary assets directly into this file—use `public/images/suggestions/` instead.
